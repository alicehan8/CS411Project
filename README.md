# CS411Project

**Tech Stack Hello World**
- We currently have connected the react front end and the flask back end and it is able to create a static web page
- Our external APIs are the Spotify API and the Google Maps API. We have gotten and implemented the authentication tokens for the Spotify API, but we are still working on the Google Maps API
- We plan on using MongoDB Atlas to store our databases in the cloud, and have connected it to our back end technology.

**We do not yet have a video, but we will soon. I apologize for the delay -- we are all very new to all the technology and it has been a learning curve to set up and connect everything. We will be sure to get the video uploaded soon, as we would love to hear your feedback!**

Thank you for your understanding!
