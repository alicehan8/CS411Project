# CS411Project

## 1) Project Description 
As a general overview, our project will create a custom Spotify playlist for the user based on their driving destination on Google Maps. Our project would take input data for a user’s trip source and destination. Then, using the Google Maps API we could extract the expected length of their commute as well as the locations themselves. This length would then become the length of the custom Spotify playlist that we would cultivate for the user’s road trip/commute. We are going to use our database to hardcode different collections of songs to match different regions and perhaps different moods to further customize the playlist generated by Spotify API for the commute. We could also save the previous locations that the user has visited to increase their ease of use in the future.

## 2) Product Requirements 
- **Goal:** Create an easy to use web application that allows me to create a Spotify playlist based on a given route 
- **Non-Goal:** Make the playlist personalized depending on how quickly the users normally travel and account for skipped songs
- **Non-Functional Requirement:** Security for the user and APIs
  - **Functional Requirement:** store API keys locally, making sure not to push to GitHub
  - **Functional Requirement:** Use OAuth for user to log into Spotify
- **Non-Functional Requirement:** Playlist customization – customizability
  - **Functional Requirement:** Playlists will be personalized based on the user’s listening activity which can be accessed through Spotify API and OAuth
  - **Functional Requirement:** Same route will result in different playlists each time, based on randomization of added songs

## 3) Project Management
- **Theme:** Provide users with personalized playlist based on the route they have to travel
- **Associated Epic:** Implement basic functionality on website
- **User Story:** As a new user, I want the functionality to be obvious so I can understand how the software works quickly
  - **Task:** Make concise UI for all functionality of our software
    - **Ticket:** provide clear spaces to enter the address of start and end points, with autofill functionality from Google Maps API
    - **Ticket:** implement OAuth to connect to user’s spotify account
- **User Story:** As a returning user, I want to be able to create a variety of playlists for repeated commutes
  - **Task:** Randomize the songs that are added to the playlist
    - **Ticket:** Use a database to store multiple songs based on location, adding a certain number of them to the playlist based on its length
    - **Ticket:** Use the information from Spotify API to base the playlist on listening activity and randomize what songs are added
